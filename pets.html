          <p>
            With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, he
            seemed to embody both the mystery and the exuberance of life itself.
            Agile and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were
            his personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. He would
            curl up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, as
            if solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and
            serene, Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities,
            teaching his human companions that one could be many things all at
            once.

          <p>
            Sprout is a 2yr old gray tabby cat. She prefers to spend her days
            sleeping on the cat tower her butler has gifted her. When she is not
            lounging around, she also likes to play attack with her favorite
            rabbit toy. <br />
            <br />
            She loves her butler dearly that when any stranger or even her
            butler's loved ones attempts to approach her, she would either run
            away or hiss at them out of annoyance.

          <p>
            Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often
            found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when
            available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves
            people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long. <br />
            <br />
            Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in
            the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and
            whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack.
